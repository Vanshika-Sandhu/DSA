DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

-> used for time optimization

-> used when the same problem is being repeated withing a given problem

-> whether dp can be implemented on the codes, following are the checks
    -> dp is implemented a code if it's solution comes in postfix order
    -> when same problem is repeated with same values

-> methods of dp
    -> memoization => uses recursion
    -> tabulation  => uses iteration
